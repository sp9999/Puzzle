[Encoding Translator](https://sp9999.github.io/Puzzle/EncodingTranslator/CodeTranslator.html)

Tool I made to easily translate letters back and forth between different encodings.
You can type in text boxes or click on boxes/radials to specify a value and should be able to see the equivalent value in other encodings.
