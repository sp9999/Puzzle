[Encoding Translator](https://sp9999.github.io/Puzzle/EncodingTranslator/CodeTranslator.html)

Tool I made to easily translate letters back and forth between different encodings.

You can type in text boxes or click on boxes/radials to specify a value and should be able to see the equivalent value in other encodings.

- Letter (A-Z)
  - Supports a single alphabet character (A-Z)
- Nato 
  - Not-editable, will display Nato equivalent for letter
- Decimal (1-26)
  - Only allows up to 2 digits, any additional digit will remove the first (FIFO)
- Binary (1-11010)
  - Only allows up to 5 0/1 characters, FIFO like decimal
- Hexadecimal (1-1A)
  - Allows 0-9 and A-F, FIFO
- Morse (- and .)
  - Allows dashes and dots up to 4 characters. FIFO
- Braille
  - Recreate the braille by clicking on the boxes that are bumps (clear button to easily clear)
- Semaphore
  - Checkboxes to dictate which of the 8 directions the flags go
- Pigpen
  - For box shape, click on sides or corner
    - Center radial on whether or not dot exists on inside
  - For cross shape, click on corners to light up a direction (center won't work) 
     - Click on the cardinal radial to both highlight that direction and dot
- Maritime
   - Click on flags to select
